# web-server

---

### description:
This is a web-server completely build in c and ultra lightweight.
Because there is a wide bandwidth on functionality you can implement, this server isn't really done yet.

At the moment the server is possible to work with POST and GET requests, parse http and parse query strings.
... so also sending browser known languages like html, css and javascript

### current workstation
The next goal is to build a dashboard around this server.
Maybe it will become my own little NAS system, build completely by myself.
